# Computer-Graphics
I've attended the course of Politecnico of Milano of "Computer Graphics".

Through Vulkan, Visual Studio programming using C++, I've done different assigments based on the following arguments: 
1 – Redering pipeline, and hardware and software architectures for 3D graphics.
2 – Basic transformation: translation, rotation, scaling and projection.
3 – Basic of computational geometry, clipping and hidden surface removal.
4 – Lighting: light sources, materials, shaders, surface normals.
5 – Texture: projection, mapping, , texture animation, alpha mapping, bump mapping, normal mapping.
6 – Advanced effects: reflection maps, BRDF models, environment maps, global illumination maps.
7 - Animation: scene graph, Bezier curves, quaternion.

Then I've created the project "Air Hockey" where two players can move paddles. In particular, the user can change the point of view among the two players or the center of the table and I had to implement the physics of the puck paying attention to the collisions.
